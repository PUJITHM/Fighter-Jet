# Fighter-Jet
The objectives of this project (game) is to fly a jet in space and to create a emulation of Fighter Jet. The viewer is allowed to operate the jet and blast of the obstacles at various difficulty levels.



ABSTRACT

OpenGL provides the programmer with an interface to graphic hardware. It is a powerful
low-level rendering library, available on all major platforms, with wide hardware support. The
code generates assets which has been applied in this game. In this we have implemented various
keyboard keys to show different moves of the jet plane. If bullet fired by the jet hits the
obstacles they vanish clearing the path for the plane. Obstacles keep falling in random manner
through various grids on the viewing volume. If any of the obstacles hit the jet the game is over.
This game is simple implementation of OpenGL functionalities and has enough challenges to
keep the player on the hot seat. The interaction is done through keyboard. When the user presses
a particular key appropriate event is generated and it will be displayed on the screen. UI is also
basic enough and easy to dig into the game-play.
